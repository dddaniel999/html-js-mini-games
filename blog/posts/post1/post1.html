        <h2>Our Mission: </h2>
        <p>Make Simple but Exciting Games Welcome, gamers and developers, to our brand-new community!</p>
          <p>Whether you are a seasoned developer, a casual gamer, or someone who is just starting to explore
          the world of game development, you have found the perfect place to
          unleash your creativity and share your passion for gaming. </p>
          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>We are a community dedicated to the art and science of creating simple
          yet thrilling games. Our mission is to foster an environment where
          innovation meets accessibility, ensuring that anyone with a love for
          games can create and share their unique experiences. Why Simple Games?
          In the ever-evolving landscape of gaming, it's easy to get lost in the
          allure of complex mechanics and stunning graphics. However, some of
          the most memorable and impactful games are those that embrace
          simplicity. Games like "Tetris," "Flappy Bird," and "Among Us" prove
          that you don't need an intricate storyline or cutting-edge graphics to
          create a hit. Simple games have a unique charm and accessibility that
          make them appealing to a broad audience. They are easy to pick up and
          play, but often hard to master, providing endless hours of fun and
          challenge.</p> 
          <h2>Our Goals </h2>
          <ul>
          <li> Empower Creators: We believe everyone has a

          artist, writer, or just someone with a great idea, we want to help you
          bring your vision to life.</li>
          <br>
           <li> Foster Collaboration: Game development
          is a collaborative effort. By connecting creators from various
          backgrounds, we aim to foster partnerships that lead to innovative and
          exciting games.</li>
          <br>
           <li> Share Knowledge: From tutorials and resources to
          forums and live Q&A sessions, we are committed to providing the tools
          and knowledge necessary to help you succeed in game development.</li>
          <br> 
          <li>
          Celebrate Simplicity: We celebrate the art of making games that are
          easy to understand but difficult to master. Our focus is on gameplay,
          creativity, and fun.</li>
